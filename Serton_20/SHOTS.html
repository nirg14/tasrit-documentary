     Historical Context
    </h2>
    <p>
     1947 Austria was divided into American, British, French and Soviet zones. Being sent back to Russian-controlled area meant likely deportation to Siberian labor camps. Austrian border guards sometimes illegally extorted or returned refugees despite being in American zone.
