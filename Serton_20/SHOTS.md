- **Total estimated shot count: 5**

**Emotional Arc:** Opens with tense illegal border crossing, sudden capture by Austrian guards, crushing announcement they're in Russian zone and must return, devastating realization of what return means - deportation to Siberia by Russians. Shows how refugees were trapped between zones with nowhere to go, at mercy of borders and bureaucrats.

**Historical Context:** 1947 Austria was divided into American, British, French and Soviet zones. Being sent back to Russian-controlled area meant likely deportation to Siberian labor camps. Austrian border guards sometimes illegally extorted or returned refugees despite being in American zone.
