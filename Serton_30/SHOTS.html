     Opens with the common refugee problem of lice infestation and the standard solution of complete head shaving, shifts to the arrival of American JOINT relief trucks bringing abundant good food, reveals the profound impact of American organization and kindness on survivors, captures the child narrator's lasting positive impression of Americans as the most humane despite their flaws, and concludes with the next stage of displacement - departure to Linz, Hitler's birthplace, continuing the ironic geography of Jewish refuge in Nazi heartland.

    <h2>
     Historical Context
    </h2>
    <p>
     The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JOINT) and UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) provided crucial aid to displaced persons in post-war Europe. Their professionalism, organization, and genuine kindness left lasting positive impressions on survivors who had experienced Nazi brutality and European indifference. The quality and abundance of American aid contrasted sharply with scarcity survivors had endured. Lice infestation was endemic in crowded DP facilities, and complete head shaving was standard treatment. Linz, Austria - Hitler's childhood home - became a major DP transit point, one of history's bitter ironies that Jewish refugees sought shelter in the Führer's birthplace. The journey through Austria continued for three months before families could move to American zone Germany.
