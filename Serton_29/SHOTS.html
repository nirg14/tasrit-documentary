            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>Pregnancy during displacement was common and often unwanted - many women became pregnant during chaotic border crossings, in DP camps, or during the early post-war period. Abortion was available in Vienna hospitals in 1947, though still carried social stigma. For Holocaust survivors, especially those in fragile health from years of starvation and trauma, pregnancy posed serious medical risks. The profound mistrust of German medical personnel was entirely justified - Jewish survivors knew about Nazi medical experiments, forced sterilizations, and medical murder. Having to trust German doctors with intimate medical procedures required overcoming deep trauma and required immense courage.</p>
