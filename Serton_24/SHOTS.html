     Opens with the first day of waiting with hope, deepens through repeated disappointment and growing fear, reveals the child's understanding of the terrible possibilities (deportation to Siberia or forced return to Hungary), and culminates in the profound anguish of a child separated from his father in a dangerous time - each day the fear growing that his father is lost forever.

     Historical Context
    </h2>
    <p>
     In 1946-1947, Soviet forces regularly stopped refugees at borders and checkpoints. Those without proper papers risked deportation to Siberian labor camps. Hungarian authorities, still hostile to Jews, would force refugees back across borders. Families were frequently separated during chaotic border crossings, and communication was impossible - refugees had no way to know if family members had been captured, deported, or turned back. Children understood these dangers intimately.
