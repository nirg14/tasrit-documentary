            <p>Opens with routine medical screening process for tuberculosis, escalates when German nurse reveals herself as unrepentant Nazi, focuses on the child's visceral rage and desire for violence against his persecutor, captures the terrible moment when she calls him "cursed Jew," and concludes with the child's barely maintained control - understanding German and Yiddish, knowing exactly what she said, capable of violence but restraining himself.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>After the war, many former Nazis remained in positions of authority in Austria and Germany, including medical facilities. Denazification was incomplete and superficial. Jewish refugees were often forced to interact with Germans who had participated in or supported the Holocaust, many of whom remained unrepentant. Medical screenings were mandatory for refugees - tuberculosis was rampant in DP camps. Children who survived the Holocaust carried sophisticated understanding of violence and harbored justified rage toward their persecutors, yet had to restrain themselves in occupied territory where Germans still held institutional power.</p>
