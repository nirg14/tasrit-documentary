     Emotional Arc
    </h2>
    <p>
     Opens with the administrative relocation from hospital to converted school, establishes the crowded classroom dormitories housing forty people each, focuses on encounter with barely-breathing elderly German woman who resents Jewish refugees, captures her bitter complaint about losing "their" schools, and concludes with the child narrator's devastating verbal counterattack in German - reminding her that Germans took Jewish blood. Shows both the bitter irony of perpetrators claiming victimhood and the child's linguistic capability to fight back verbally.

    <h2>
     Historical Context
    </h2>
    <p>
     After WWII, German and Austrian buildings were requisitioned by Allied authorities for displaced persons housing. Schools, hospitals, and other institutions were converted to refugee facilities. Many Germans resented these requisitions and saw themselves as victims, displaying remarkable blindness to their role as perpetrators. Jewish child survivors often spoke multiple languages - Yiddish, German, Hungarian, Romanian - giving them the ability to understand and respond to German complaints. The bitter irony of Germans complaining about losing schools while Jews had lost entire families was not lost on survivors, even young children who had witnessed the Holocaust firsthand.
