     Historical Context
    </h2>
    <p>
     Music played a vital role in sustaining spirits in displaced persons camps and transit facilities. Harmonica was a common instrument - portable, durable, and capable of expressing deep emotion. Survivors would gather to sing Yiddish songs, religious melodies, and folk tunes from their lost homes. These moments of shared culture provided psychological survival, maintaining human dignity and cultural identity amid displacement. The act of making music together was a form of resistance against dehumanization.
