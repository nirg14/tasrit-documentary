## 🎬 Production Workflow

### For Each Serton:

1. **Open SHOTS.md file** in the Serton folder
2. **Review scene overview** (setting, tone, action)
3. **For each shot:**
   - Read the shot description
   - Copy **Image Prompt** into Midjourney
   - Generate first frame
   - Download and save to `images/` folder
   - Copy **Video Prompt** into Midjourney video
   - Animate the generated frame
   - Download animated shot

4. **Sequence shots** in editing software
5. **Add narration** from `script.txt`
6. **Check off** items in `production_notes.md`

3. Open `SHOTS.md`
4. For each shot placeholder:
   - Identify specific visual moment
   - Write detailed Image Prompt
   - Write detailed Video Prompt
   - Specify camera, lighting, emotion
5. Update production notes
6. Add historical references

## 🔍 Example: How to Use a SHOTS.md File

1. Navigate to `Serton_05/SHOTS.md`
2. Read Scene Overview
3. Go to Shot 1
4. Copy the entire Image Prompt block
5. Paste into Midjourney:
   ```
   /imagine Narrow wooden attic stairway ascending into darkness,
   small boy climbing with one hand touching rough wall, dim light
   from above casting long shadows down the stairs, weathered steps,
   dust floating in shaft of weak daylight, claustrophobic framing,
   2D animated historical illustration, heavily desaturated sepia
   tones, muted browns and greys, high-contrast chiaroscuro,
   oppressive shadows engulfing lower stairs, serious evocative tone,
   1940s Bucharest attic, moving painting style
   ```
6. Generate image
7. Save as `Serton_05/images/shot_01_frame.png`
8. Use Video Prompt to animate:
   ```
   Slow tracking shot following child from below, climbing step
   by step, creaking wood sounds, heavy breathing, dust particles
   swirling in disturbed air, shadows shifting with each step upward,
   slow tense pacing, hand sliding along wall for support,
   maintaining atmosphere of retreat into hiding and mounting fear
   ```
9. Save animated version as `Serton_05/images/shot_01_video.mp4`
10. Repeat for all 6 shots in Serton 05
