            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>Rescue trucks from Vienna DP camps had limited capacity. Many refugees had to wait for subsequent transports. Cultural codes of gentlemanly behavior meant some refused to push or shove despite desperate circumstances. Children who had already experienced separation from parents during war years had acute anxiety about any new separation.</p>
