## Production Notes

- [x] All shots reviewed for style consistency
- [x] Historical accuracy verified (overcrowded rescue transports, gentleman's code)
- [x] Emotional progression mapped: arrival → chaos → refusal → desperate plea
- [x] Transitions between shots planned
- [x] Color palette consistent across shots
- **Total estimated shot count: 4**

**Emotional Arc:** Opens with hopeful arrival of rescue truck, descends into chaotic desperation to board overcrowded vehicle, focuses on father's principled refusal to push others aside despite desperate son's pleading. Heartbreaking moment showing how code of conduct and dignity could conflict with survival needs, with child caught between understanding father's honor and terror of another separation.

**Historical Context:** Rescue trucks from Vienna DP camps had limited capacity. Many refugees had to wait for subsequent transports. Cultural codes of gentlemanly behavior meant some refused to push or shove despite desperate circumstances. Children who had already experienced separation from parents during war years had acute anxiety about any new separation.
