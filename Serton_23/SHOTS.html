            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>The Rothschild Hospital in Vienna became a major gathering point for Jewish refugees fleeing Eastern Europe in 1945-1947. Originally a Jewish hospital, it was converted into a displaced persons transit facility, often housing far more people than it was designed for. Refugees would stay here temporarily while arranging passage to DP camps in the American zones of Austria and Germany.</p>
