            <h2>Emotional Arc</h2>
            <p>Opens with the child's continued lonely vigil, deepens through yet another false hope as a truck arrives without his father, captures the heartbreaking simile of walking away like a puppy whose owner hasn't come home, shifts dramatically to the joy of reunion when father finally arrives after a week or more, and concludes with the revelation that a Jewish farmer sheltered the group - showing human kindness amid chaos.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>Many Jewish farmers and rural families in Austria and Hungary, who had survived the war in hiding or through other means, showed remarkable generosity to refugees passing through in 1946-1947. Despite their own limited resources, they would shelter groups for days or weeks, providing fresh milk, cheese, and safety. Communication was impossible - there were no phones or mail systems functioning reliably, so families separated during border crossings had no way to send word. This made every separation a potential permanent loss.</p>
