    <h2>
     Historical Context
    </h2>
    <p>
     Many Jewish farmers and rural families in Austria and Hungary, who had survived the war in hiding or through other means, showed remarkable generosity to refugees passing through in 1946-1947. Despite their own limited resources, they would shelter groups for days or weeks, providing fresh milk, cheese, and safety. Communication was impossible - there were no phones or mail systems functioning reliably, so families separated during border crossings had no way to send word. This made every separation a potential permanent loss.
